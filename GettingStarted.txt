All of your API code should fit into one file that will be placed into the routes folder.


// Including these line at the start of your code will allow for express funtions to work as well as routes
    import express from 'express';
    import db from '../db.js';
    const router = express.Router();

// import db... allows for your code to access the db.js file when you run the line
    db.query(var (error, results) => {....})
// and will automatically connect you with the database


// make sure to end your code with the line
    export default router;

// when first creating and running your code for the first time make sure that within index.js you update the code with the lines
    import filenameRoutes from './routes/filename.js';
    app.use('/filename', filenameRoutes);

//To run your local server and test your code,
//open your temrminal into the directory NODE_EXPRESS_API
// and run the line

    npm start 

//To end the connection when a crash or error oucrrs press ctrl + c then y for yes.
